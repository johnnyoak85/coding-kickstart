title: Coding Practices and Patterns
---

Good coding practices and patterns are the backbone of creating software that’s easy to maintain, scale, and improve. They help keep your code clean, understandable, and adaptable to changes. Let’s dive into some essential practices that every developer, whether working on web apps or games, should keep in mind.

## Convention over Configuration

The idea here is simple: stick to standard conventions as much as possible. When everyone on the team follows the same rules, you spend less time configuring things and more time building cool stuff.

- **Stick to common conventions** to keep things consistent and reduce unnecessary setup.

  - **Web Example**: Use the same naming style for variables and functions throughout your project.
  - **Game Example**: Apply consistent naming and formatting in your game scripts to make them easier to read and manage.

## Law of Demeter (Principle of Least Knowledge)

This principle, also known as the "Don’t Talk to Strangers" rule, suggests that a function should only interact with its direct dependencies. The less your code knows about other parts of the system, the easier it is to change and maintain.

- **Keep functions focused** on their immediate dependencies to simplify your code.

  ```javascript
  // Bad (Web)
  class User {
    constructor(app) {
      this.app = app;
    }

    getProfile() {
      return this.app.database.getUserProfile(this);
    }
  }

  // Good (Web)
  class User {
    constructor(database) {
      this.database = database;
    }

    getProfile() {
      return this.database.getUserProfile(this);
    }
  }

  // Bad (Game)
  class Player {
    constructor(game) {
      this.game = game;
    }

    getScore() {
      return this.game.scoreManager.getPlayerScore(this);
    }
  }

  // Good (Game)
  class Player {
    constructor(scoreManager) {
      this.scoreManager = scoreManager;
    }

    getScore() {
      return this.scoreManager.getPlayerScore(this);
    }
  }
  ```

## Continuous Feedback and Iteration

In agile development, you’re constantly testing and tweaking your code to make sure it’s the best it can be. Regular feedback loops help you catch issues early and adapt quickly to new requirements.

- **Test and update your code regularly** to stay on top of changes and maintain high quality.

  - **Web Example**: Use automated testing tools like Jest to continuously check your code as you develop.
  - **Game Example**: Run playtesting sessions to get feedback on game mechanics and adjust accordingly.

## Robustness & Error Prevention

Robustness is all about making sure your software can handle unexpected inputs without crashing. It’s like putting up safety nets so your program doesn’t break when something goes wrong.

- **Build your software to handle unexpected situations gracefully**.

  ```javascript
  // Web Example
  function processUserInput(input) {
    if (typeof input !== "string") {
      throw new Error("Invalid input type");
    }
    // process the input
  }

  // Game Example
  function processGameCommand(command) {
    if (!command || typeof command !== "string") {
      throw new Error("Invalid command");
    }
    // execute command
  }
  ```

- **Prevent errors before they happen** with strategies like input validation and automated tests.

  - **Web Use Case**: Use a library like Joi for input validation in Node.js apps to catch issues early.
  - **Game Use Case**: Set up automated tests to verify that your game logic works as expected.

## Performance Optimization

Performance matters, especially in games where smooth operation is key. Writing efficient code means your software runs faster and uses resources more wisely.

- **Write small, focused functions** to keep your code efficient and manageable.

  ```javascript
  // Web Example
  function calculateUserStats(users) {
    // complex logic for multiple stats
  }

  // Good
  function calculateUserScore(user) {
    /* ... */
  }
  function calculateUserRank(user) {
    /* ... */
  }

  // Game Example
  function calculateGameStats(players) {
    // complex logic for multiple stats
  }

  // Good
  function calculatePlayerScore(player) {
    /* ... */
  }
  function calculatePlayerRank(player) {
    /* ... */
  }
  ```

- **Optimize for real-time performance**, which is especially crucial in games.

  - **Web Use Case**: Make sure your database queries are efficient to keep response times low.
  - **Game Use Case**: Use techniques like object pooling to manage resources in your game without slowing things down.

## Scalability

Scalability is about designing your software so it can grow and handle more users or data without requiring major changes. A modular design makes it easier to expand and adapt your project as it evolves.

- **Keep your code modular** so it’s ready to grow with your project.

  - **Web Use Case**: Consider using microservices architecture to scale different parts of your web app independently.
  - **Game Use Case**: Design your game systems as separate modules, making it easy to add new features or content later on.
