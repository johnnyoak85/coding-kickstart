title: SOLID Principles
---

The SOLID principles are like the golden rules of software design. They help you write code that’s easy to understand, maintain, and extend, which is super important, especially in object-oriented programming. Whether you’re working on a web app or a game, these principles can really boost your code quality.

## SRP (Single Responsibility Principle) & Modularity

The SRP is all about focus: each class or module should only have one job or responsibility. If something changes, there should only be one reason for that class to change. Alongside this, modularity means breaking your program down into smaller, independent parts that work together.

### Tips for SRP & Modularity

- **Keep Related Logic Together**: Stick to keeping related code in one place.

  - **Game Example**: Handle all player-related stuff in a `Player` class.
  - **Web Example**: Use a `User` class to manage everything user-related.

- **Separate Logic and UI**: Don’t mix business logic with user interface code.

  - **Game Example**: Separate the game mechanics from how the game looks.
  - **Web Example**: Use one module for data processing and another for rendering the UI.

- **Break Code into Modules**: Split your code into small, independent files.

  - **Game Example**: Use different files for different game parts, like `Player.js` and `Enemy.js`.
  - **Web Example**: Organize your web app into modules like `Auth.js` and `Dashboard.js`.

- **Write Small, Single-Purpose Functions**: Focus on making each function do just one thing.

  ```javascript
  // Not Ideal
  function updatePlayer(player, score, level) {
    player.score += score;
    player.level = level;
    console.log("Player updated");
  }

  // Better
  function updatePlayerScore(player, score) {
    player.score += score;
  }

  function updatePlayerLevel(player, level) {
    player.level = level;
  }
  ```

## OCP (Open/Closed Principle)

The OCP suggests that your code should be open to extension but closed to modification. This means you should be able to add new features without having to change the existing code.

### Tips for OCP

- **Design for Flexibility**: Plan your code so you can add new features without touching what’s already there.

  ```javascript
  // Not Ideal
  class Game {
    render3D() {
      /* ... */
    }
    render2D() {
      /* ... */
    }
  }

  // Better
  class Game {
    render(renderer) {
      renderer.render();
    }
  }
  ```

  - **Game Example**: Add new rendering methods without changing the core `Game` class.
  - **Web Example**: Integrate new payment methods into your e-commerce site without touching the existing payment code.

## LSP (Liskov Substitution Principle)

LSP is about making sure that objects of a superclass can be replaced with objects of a subclass without messing up the program. Basically, any subclass should be able to stand in for its parent class without causing errors.

- **Use Immutable Objects**: These prevent accidental changes.
- **Favor Composition Over Inheritance**: This gives you more flexibility.

  ```javascript
  // Not Ideal
  class Bird extends Animal {
    fly() {
      console.log("Flying...");
    }
  }

  // Better
  class FlyingAbility {
    fly() {
      console.log("Flying...");
    }
  }

  class Animal {
    constructor(flyingAbility) {
      this.flyingAbility = flyingAbility;
    }

    performFly() {
      if (this.flyingAbility) {
        this.flyingAbility.fly();
      } else {
        console.log("This animal can't fly.");
      }
    }
  }

  const flyingAbility = new FlyingAbility();
  const bird = new Animal(flyingAbility);

  bird.performFly(); // Outputs: "Flying..."
  ```

  - **Game Example**: Add abilities to characters without changing their class hierarchy.
  - **Web Example**: Switch between different authentication strategies (like OAuth and JWT) without changing your user management system.

## ISP (Interface Segregation Principle)

The ISP advises against forcing a class to implement methods it doesn’t need. Instead, create smaller, more specific interfaces.

### Tips for ISP

- **Design Specific Interfaces**: Tailor interfaces to fit the needs of your clients.

  ```javascript
  // Not Ideal
  class GameControls {
    move() {
      /* ... */
    }
    shoot() {
      /* ... */
    }
    fly() {
      /* ... */
    }
  }

  // Better
  class GroundControls {
    move() {
      /* ... */
    }
    shoot() {
      /* ... */
    }
  }

  class AirControls {
    fly() {
      /* ... */
    }
  }
  ```

  - **Game Example**: Different control interfaces for ground and air vehicles.
  - **Web Example**: Separate interfaces for different user roles, like admin and regular users.

## DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle)

### Tips for DIP

- **Depend on Abstractions, Not Details**: Write your code so that it depends on abstractions, not specific implementations.

  ```javascript
  // Not Ideal
  class Game {
    constructor() {
      this.renderer = new WebGLRenderer();
    }
  }

  // Better
  class Game {
    constructor(renderer) {
      this.renderer = renderer;
    }
  }

  const gameRenderer = new WebGLRenderer();
  const game = new Game(gameRenderer);
  ```

  - **Game Example**: Swap out different rendering engines (like WebGL or Canvas) without changing your game’s logic.
  - **Web Example**: Use dependency injection to switch between different database systems (like MongoDB or PostgreSQL) without altering your data access code.
