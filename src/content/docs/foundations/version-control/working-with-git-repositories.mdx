title: Working with Git Repositories

## Creating a New Repository

So, you’ve got a project and you’re ready to start using Git to keep everything in check? Awesome! First up, you need a place to store all your project files and track their changes—this is what we call a repository (or "repo" for short). Here’s how to set one up:

1. **Go to Your Project Folder**: Open up your command line and navigate to the folder where your project lives.

   ```sh
   cd path/to/your/project
   ```

2. **Initialize Git**: Now, let’s tell Git to start tracking changes in this folder by turning it into a Git repository:

   ```sh
   git init
   ```

   Boom! You’ve just created a new Git repository in your project folder.

## Adding and Committing Files

Next, let’s get Git to start keeping an eye on your files. This is called "staging" and "committing." Think of it like snapping a picture of your project at a certain point in time.

1. **Stage Your Files**: To tell Git which files you want to track, use this command:

   ```sh
   git add .
   ```

   :::note
   The `.` here tells Git to stage everything in the current directory. If you only want to add specific files, you can list them individually.
   :::

2. **Commit Your Changes**: Once your files are staged, save them to your repo with a commit message. This message should briefly describe what changes you’ve made.

   A good commit should:

   - **Focus on One Thing**: Each commit should deal with a single task or change.
   - **Keep Things Working**: Make sure your commit doesn’t break anything.
   - **Use a Prefix**: Start your commit message with a word that explains what kind of change it is.
   - **Be Brief and Clear**: Describe the change in a few words.
   - **Start with a Verb**: Use the present tense, like "add" or "fix."
   - **Format Properly**: Stick to lowercase letters and hyphens for easy reading.

     Here’s an example:

     ```sh
     git commit -m "chore: initial commit"
     ```

3. **Keep Going**: As you keep working on your project, you’ll make more changes. For each change:

   - **Stage the File**: Add it to the staging area:

     ```sh
     git add <filename>
     ```

   - **Commit with a Clear Message**: Describe what you did:

     ```sh
     git commit -m "fix: brief description of the change"
     ```

### What Do Those Commit Message Prefixes Mean?

- `chore:`: For routine tasks that don’t change your code’s functionality.
- `ci:`: For updating continuous integration stuff.
- `docs:`: For when you add or update documentation.
- `feat:`: For when you add a new feature.
- `fix:`: For squashing bugs.
- `refactor:`: For changing the structure of your code without changing what it does.
- `style:`: For tweaks like reformatting code.
- `test:`: For adding or updating tests.

## Basic Git Commands

You’re going to use these commands a lot, so let’s get comfy with them:

- **Check What’s Going On**: See what’s changed and what’s staged for commit.

  ```sh
  git status
  ```

- **Look Back in Time**: Check out the history of all your commits.

  ```sh
  git log
  ```

- **Make Changes**: Edit your files, then stage and commit them as you go.

  ```sh
  git add <filename>
  git commit -m "Describe your changes"
  ```

- **See What’s Different**: Compare your current files to the last commit to see what’s changed.

  ```sh
  git diff
  ```
