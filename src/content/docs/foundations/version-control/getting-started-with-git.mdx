## Whats Git?

Alright, let’s talk about **Git**. Git is one of the most popular version control systems out there, and for good reason! It helps you keep track of all the changes you make to your code, and it makes working with others a breeze. With Git, you can save different versions of your project, go back in time if something breaks, and team up with other developers without worrying about messing up each other’s work. Whether you’re a total newbie or have been coding for a while, Git’s got your back.

## Installing Git

### On Windows

1. **Grab Git for Windows**: Head over to [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and grab the installer.
2. **Run the Installer**: Just follow the steps—it’s pretty straightforward. The default settings are usually fine, so you can just click through.

### On macOS

- **Use Terminal**: Open up Terminal and type:

  ```sh
  brew install git
  ```

### On Linux

- **Use Your Package Manager**: Open Terminal and run:

  ```sh
  sudo apt-get install git
  ```

  :::caution
  This command works for Debian-based systems like Ubuntu. If you’re on something else (like Fedora or Red Hat), use your system’s package manager (`yum`, `dnf`, etc.).

## Setting Up Git

Now that Git’s all set up on your machine, let’s do a quick configuration to personalize it with your name and email. This info gets stamped on your commits so people know who made what changes.

- Open Terminal and type in:

  ```sh
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
  git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
  ```

  And that’s it! You’re ready to start using Git.
