## What is a Merge/Pull Request?

A Merge Request (MR) or Pull Request (PR) is your way of contributing changes to a project. When you create an MR/PR, you're essentially asking to merge your changes from one branch into another (usually the main branch). This process is key for collaboration, ensuring that your changes are reviewed and approved before they become part of the main codebase.

## Creating a Merge/Pull Request

A well-organized merge or pull request is crucial for smooth collaboration and maintaining high code quality. Here’s how to create an effective MR/PR:

### Steps to Create a Merge/Pull Request

1. **Keep It Small**: Try to make your MR/PR as focused and small as possible. Smaller requests are easier to review and less likely to cause bugs.
2. **Review and Test**: Before submitting, thoroughly check your own code and make sure all tests pass. This reduces the chance of errors being caught during the review.
3. **Single Commit? Use It as the Title**: If your MR/PR has only one commit, use that commit message as the title.
4. **Multiple Commits? Summarize It**: If your MR/PR has multiple commits, summarize the changes in a clear and concise title.
5. **Explain the Purpose**: Use the description field to clearly explain what your MR/PR does and why it’s necessary.
6. **Assign It to Yourself**: Take responsibility for your MR/PR by assigning it to yourself.
7. **Add Reviewers**: Assign one or more team members as reviewers to ensure your code gets a second pair of eyes before merging.

### Branch Naming Conventions

Using consistent branch names helps everyone understand the purpose of each branch. Here are some examples:

- `feature/feature-name` for new features
- `fix/bug-description` for bug fixes
- `hotfix/critical-bug` for urgent fixes that need to go into the production branch quickly

To make sure your branch is up to date with the latest changes from the main branch, run this command before merging:

```bash
git pull --rebase origin main
```

If there are new commits, resolve any conflicts, and push your changes:

```bash
git push -f
```

This helps keep the commit history clean and easy to follow.

### Squashing Commits

If your MR/PR includes small, incremental changes to the same feature or fix, consider squashing your commits into one. This makes the commit history cleaner and easier to understand. You can do this with:

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~<number_of_commits>
```

Choose "squash" for the commits you want to combine.

### Handling Merge Conflicts

Sometimes, you might encounter merge conflicts during a rebase. Here’s how to handle them:

1. **Identify Conflicts**: Run git status to see which files have conflicts.
2. **Resolve Conflicts**: Open the conflicting files, resolve the conflicts, and save your changes.
3. **Continue the Rebase**: Once conflicts are resolved, continue the rebase with:

   ```bash
   git add <resolved-file>
   git rebase --continue
   ```

If you're unsure how to resolve a conflict, ask a team member or reviewer for help. Always communicate any significant conflicts that could impact other parts of the project.

### Final Review Checklist

Before you submit your MR/PR, make sure you’ve:

- [ ] Cleaned up your code, removing any commented-out code or debugging statements.
- [ ] Passed all tests and added new ones if needed.
- [ ] Updated documentation to reflect any changes.
- [ ] Written clear and concise commit messages.
- [ ] Clearly explained the purpose and impact of the changes in the MR/PR description.

## Code Review Process

Every pull request goes through a code review to ensure it meets the project's standards for quality, maintainability, and style.

### What to Expect During Code Review

1. **Assessment**: A Git master or team reviewer will assess your code for functionality, clarity, efficiency, and adherence to standards.
2. **Feedback and Suggestions**: The reviewer will provide comments, which might include identifying bugs, suggesting improvements, or asking questions.
3. **Discussion and Revisions**: You’ll have the chance to discuss the feedback and make any necessary changes before the code is merged.

### Tips for a Smooth Code Review

- **Stay Focused**: Keep your MR/PR focused on a single feature or bug fix to make the review easier.
- **Clear Commit Messages**: Write clear and descriptive commit messages.
- **Include Documentation and Tests**: If your changes require updates to documentation or new tests, include them in your MR/PR.
- **Respond Quickly**: Engage with the review process by responding to feedback and making changes promptly.

### Linking to Issues

If you’re using a [Kanban Board](kanban.md)] or issue tracker, link your MR/PR to the relevant issue. This helps reviewers understand the context and purpose of your changes. You can do this by referencing the issue number in your MR/PR title or description, e.g., "Fixes #1234".
