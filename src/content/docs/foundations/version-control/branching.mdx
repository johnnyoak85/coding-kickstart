## What’s Branching?

Branching in Git is like making a copy of your project where you can try out new ideas or work on features without messing with the main code. Think of a branch as your own little workspace. When you’re done and everything looks good, you can merge it back into the main project.

### Why Bother with Branches?

- **Keep Things Separate**: You can work on new features or fix bugs without touching the main codebase.
- **Teamwork Made Easy**: Everyone can have their own branch to work on without stepping on each other’s toes.
- **Safe Experimentation**: Want to try something new? Do it in a branch! If it doesn’t work out, no worries—it won’t affect the main project.

## Branch Naming Guidelines

Here’s how to keep your branches organized and easy to identify:

1. Start each branch name with a **tag** that helps identify its purpose.
2. Add a **slash** after the tag.

   1. Include the **issue ticket number** next, to link the branch to a specific task or card.
   2. Follow the number with a **hyphen**.
   3. Then add a **brief description** of the issue or feature.

3. Use **hyphens** to separate words in the description.
4. Stick to **lowercase letters and hyphens**—it keeps things clean and easy to read.

### What Do Those Branch Name Tags Mean?

- `feature/`: For developing new features or functionality.
- `bugfix/`: For fixing identified bugs or issues in the code.
- `hotfix/`: For urgent fixes, typically applied directly to production.
- `release/`: For preparing and stabilizing code for a new release.
- `chore/`: For routine tasks, maintenance, or housekeeping that don't directly affect functionality.
- `improvement/`: For enhancing existing features or optimizing performance.
- `experiment/`: For trying out new ideas or concepts, not necessarily for production.
- `docs/`: For adding or updating documentation.
- `refactor/`: For restructuring existing code without changing its external behavior.
- `test/`: For adding or updating tests.

## Creating and Switching Branches

### How to Create a New Branch

Ready to start something new? Here’s how to create a branch:

```sh
git branch <branch_name>
```

Just replace `<branch_name>` with a descriptive name that follows the guidelines above.

#### Examples

```sh
git branch <nametag/description>
```

```sh
git branch <nametag/issue_number-description>
```

### Switching to a Branch

Need to hop over to another branch? You’ve got two options:

- The classic way:

  ```sh
  git checkout <branch_name>
  ```

- Or the newer, snazzier way:
  ```sh
  git switch <branch_name>
  ```

### Create and Switch in One Go

If you want to create a new branch and jump straight into it, use:

- The classic way:
  ```sh
  git checkout -b <branch_name>
  ```
- Or the newer syntax:
  ```sh
  git switch -c <branch_name>
  ```
